"Subtitle Text [Slide Page] Next Subtitle Text [Slide Page] ..."

Extract the main ideas and concepts from the video into bullet points for students and pupils to learn from.
Create a bullet point for each interesting information together with a longer text explanation, which explains the bullet point in more detail.
