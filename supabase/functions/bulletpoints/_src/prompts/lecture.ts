Okay, so hello everyone. Today is the last lecture of the series of lecture on component analysis.
So we've seen CCA, ICA, and today we look at some more general, which is representation learning.

So to set up the ID, basically you have an observation space, which can be, for example, images, but this could also be sounds or any data you observe.

Example End

Extract the main ideas and concepts from the text into bullet points for students and pupils to learn from.
You have to either create new bullet points or update the existing bullet points with the new information from the lecture.
Create a bullet point for each interesting information together with a longer text explanation, which explains the bullet point in more detail.
The goal is that students can later look at the bullet points and learn from them, therefore they have to be accurate and you should not invent facts are concept.

Return a json array of bullet points with the bullet points and long summary and the starting page where they occur in JSON format.

[
{
    "bullet_point": "Updated Bullet Point 1",
    "longer_explanation": "Updated Longer explanation of bullet point 1.",
    "page": 3
},
...
]
