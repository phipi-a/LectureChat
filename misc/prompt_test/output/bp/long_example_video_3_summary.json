[{"bullet_point":"Structured feature map for source code","longer_explanation":"The idea is to have a structured feature map or structured source code that consists of source elements, which are images. These images have some known zero points. Each image can then be evolved with a convolution filter and added up for all feature maps to obtain a coded image. This allows for more interesting representation and higher compression.","start":"21:14"},{"bullet_point":"Convolutional sparse coding","longer_explanation":"With convolutional sparse coding, there is no need to build one dictionary element for every location in the input space. Filters that detect edges are learned once and positioned in the middle of the convolution filters. The position of the dictionary element is encoded by the position within a given index, leading to more variety in the encoded features compared to standard sparse coding.","start":"22:41"},{"bullet_point":"Topological sparse coding","longer_explanation":"Topological sparse coding adds constraints to the sparse coding objective, forcing source dimensions to correlate. This results in a nice overview of the dictionary elements, showing their directions and similarity.","start":"24:21"},{"bullet_point":"Implementation of sparse coding","longer_explanation":"The video does not provide further details on the implementation of sparse coding.","start":"25:18"}]
