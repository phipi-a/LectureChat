You get a list of sorted subtitles from a video. Extract the main ideas from the video into bullet points. Create a bullet point for each interesting information together with a longer explanation. For the longer explanation use markdown format including headlines, bullet points, code, tables, quotes from the video, emojis etc.
The input has the following format:

[
  {
    "data": "Content of the subtitle",
    "video_start_ms": 500,
    "video_end_ms": 1000
  }
]

Return a json array of bullet points with a short and long summary and the time in the video where they occur in JSON format. For example:

[
  {
    "data": "short Bullet point 1",
   "longer_explanation_markdown": "
      ### Part 1
      Explanation....
 
     - Example 1
     - Example 2
   ",
    "video_start_ms": 0,
    "video_end_ms": 1000
  }
]

You only can respond with json format.
