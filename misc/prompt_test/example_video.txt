Well, that ability to perform","video_start_ms":29.76,"video_end_ms":36.72},{"text":" object identification that comes so easily to us does not come so easily to a computer,","video_start_ms":36.72,"video_end_ms":42.88},{"text":" but that is where we can apply something called convolutional neural networks to the problem.","video_start_ms":42.88,"video_end_ms":50.24},{"text":" Now, a convolutional neural network or a CNN is a area of deep learning, but specializes in","video_start_ms":50.24,"video_end_ms":62.24},{"text":" pattern recognition. My name is Martin Keen, and I work in the IBM Garage at IBM. Now, let's take a","video_start_ms":62.24,"video_end_ms":71.84},{"text":" look at how CNN works at a high level. Well, let's break it down. CNN, convolutional neural network,","video_start_ms":71.84,"video_end_ms":80.08},{"text":" well, let's start with the artificial neural network part. This is a standard network that","video_start_ms":80.08,"video_end_ms":86.56},{"text":" consists of multiple layers that are interconnected, and each layer receives some input,","video_start_ms":86.56,"video_end_ms":93.2},{"text":" transforms that input to something else, and passes it as output to the next layer. That's","video_start_ms":94.32,"video_end_ms":99.52},{"text":" how neural networks work. And CNN is a particular part of the neural network, or a section of layers,","video_start_ms":100.4,"video_end_ms":107.28},{"text":" let's say it's these three layers here. And within these layers, we have something called filters,","video_start_ms":107.28,"video_end_ms":114.24},{"text":" and it's the filters that perform the pattern recognition that CNN is so good at.","video_start_ms":115.12,"video_end_ms":123.04},{"text":" So, let's apply this to our house example. Now, if this house were an actual image, it would be","video_start_ms":124,"video_end_ms":131.52},{"text":" a series of pixels, just like any image. And if we zoom in on a particular part of this house,","video_start_ms":131.52,"video_end_ms":141.36},{"text":" let's say we zoom in around here, then we would get, well, the window. And what we're saying here","video_start_ms":141.36,"video_end_ms":150.08},{"text":" is that a window consists of some perfectly straight lines, almost perfectly straight lines.","video_start_ms":150.08,"video_end_ms":157.36},{"text":" But you know, a window doesn't need to look like that. A window could equally look like this,","video_start_ms":157.36,"video_end_ms":161.36},{"text":" and we would still say it was a window. The cool thing about CNN is that using filters,","video_start_ms":161.36,"video_end_ms":167.92},{"text":" CNN could also say that these two objects represent the same thing. The way they do that, then,","video_start_ms":167.92,"video_end_ms":173.92},{"text":" is through the application of these filters. So, let's take a look at how that works. Now,","video_start_ms":173.92,"video_end_ms":178.8},{"text":" a filter is basically just a three by three block. And within that block, we can specify a","video_start_ms":178.8,"video_end_ms":186.88},{"text":" pattern to look for. So, we could say, let's look for a pattern like this, a right angle in our","video_start_ms":186.88,"video_end_ms":196.4},{"text":" image. So, what we do is we take this filter, and it's a three by three block here. We will analyze","video_start_ms":196.4,"video_end_ms":202.32},{"text":" the equivalent three by three block up here as well. So, we'll look at, first of all, these first","video_start_ms":202.32,"video_end_ms":209.12},{"text":" group of three by three pixels, and we will see how close are they to the filter shape.","video_start_ms":209.12,"video_end_ms":216.32},{"text":" And we'll give that a numeric score. Then, we will move across one column to the right,","video_start_ms":216.32,"video_end_ms":222.88},{"text":" and look at the next three by three block of pixels, and score how close they are to the filter","video_start_ms":222.88,"video_end_ms":227.52},{"text":" shape. And we will continue to slide over or convolt over all of these pixel layers until we have","video_start_ms":227.52,"video_end_ms":235.12},{"text":" mapped every three by three block. Now, that's just for one filter, but what that will give us is","video_start_ms":235.12,"video_end_ms":243.12},{"text":" an array of numbers that say how closely an image matches our filter. But we can add more filters.","video_start_ms":243.12,"video_end_ms":250.96},{"text":" So, we could add another three by three filter here, and perhaps this one looks for a shape","video_start_ms":250.96,"video_end_ms":256.08},{"text":" like this. And we could add a third filter here, and perhaps this looks for a different kind of","video_start_ms":256.72,"video_end_ms":263.84},{"text":" right angle shape. If we take the numeric arrays from all of these filters and combine them together","video_start_ms":263.84,"video_end_ms":271.92},{"text":" in a process called pooling, then we have a much better understanding of what is contained within","video_start_ms":271.92,"video_end_ms":278.48},{"text":" this series of pixels. Now, that's just the first layer of the CNN. And as we go deeper into the","video_start_ms":278.48,"video_end_ms":285.84},{"text":" neural network, the filters become more abstract or they can do more. So, the second layer of filters","video_start_ms":285.84,"video_end_ms":293.76},{"text":" perhaps can perform tasks like basic object recognition.
