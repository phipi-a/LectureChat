Our first question we had in mind is, how satisfied are you with the current state of teaching, specifically at schools? 

[Weßels]
I will answer more specifically, about the question of what I think about the use of AI in teaching at schools and universities. And I'm always so torn and that was also the case yesterday in the sessions. Of course you experience a bubble here [at republica] that has a very strong IT affinity. And there are a lot of great people here who want to advance the use of AI in schools or universities. So the protagonists are gathered here, so the overall impression is somehow very optimistic when you're here, because you always meet such enthusiastic people or absolute experts on this topic. That is, in sum, if you look at it realistically and try grasp the overall situation. So I don't presume to see every detail, but so my impression is, we experience everything. So we experience people, that for some reason, I don´t know why, somehow have not even heard about that topic. Or who have not perceived it as relevant. And we experience those who think every day about how they can use the opportunities and the potential of this technology in their teaching in School, in the teaching in University, but also for the learning process of the students and who are super creative. But I also see others like yesterday,  who say, "Hey, the university management hasn't contacted us at all yet, we don't know anything."

And students even say to us "I just prompt all my essays". We had someone yesterday. He said I'll get perfect score. All there is at my course of studies is writing essays, I just prompt them and they are great. He had obviously developed a high level of expertise. But I would argue that the other side the professors may not even know that. So there are no rules of the game that have been agreed upon. For me, it is completely incomprehensible that the university management does not perceive this as a responsibility, which they should take care of and that is the bad thing: We want to be pioneers in education, we don't want to be behind, and then a tool like ChatGPT comes around the corner on the 30th. of November. You could have seen all this beforehand. That was also our mission with my co-founders of the AI Competence Center and for years, since 2020, at least since 2020, so for years we have announced, there is something, there is something coming. And a lot of things were already there, but nobody foresaw that it would also be released as a chat variant and due to ChatGpt we now have an extreme attention and a real awareness for the topic. But since the 30th of November until today half a year has passed and how can it be that the university management... Not all, obviously, but after yesterday's feedback, there are still many  universities which haven`t addressed the topic at all and also students are left in a legal vacuum and have to deal with question: Am i allowed to do that? Can I admit I used it or will I be punished? And if I do, will it be treated as plagiarism, which it isn´t actually according to our German legal understanding. Confusion and irritation there as well. So many open questions.

[Philipp]
It all reminds me a bit of digitization in the early days and the fact that there is so much uncertainty about how to deal with it or how to deal with it in teaching. How do you think this will be handled with regard to AI, what are the reasons why it should be different this time, or whether we are more likely to see the situation repeated in exactly the same way again? 

[Weßels]
The change we are experiencing now has a different intensity. It is now disruptive. It raises so many questions and has such a powerful impact, which is why we have to address the problem on the other side, so to speak, if we look at it in a more abstract way. In the problem space, we now have a digital disruption with an impact the likes of which I, at least, have never experienced before. This means that in the solution space, too, we have to counter this with something equivalent in the same way. And that also means that we have to be disruptive, so to speak, in our structures. We must dare to do something completely new and apply completely new patterns and structures that we have not had before. And whether we succeed in doing that is also a collective effort and requires awareness, but also a lot of courage to move onto this ice. Because we don't have a hedge yet. We've all never done it before. And I did KI writing workshops with students for the first time in 2021 and then really just experimented with these tools, presented that to students and we wrote texts and analyzed and evaluated that, up and down. But nethertheless it's like an experiment what we have to dare now. There aren't any textbooks or experts that you can ask. No, we are all in such an experiment now and now it's going a full speed ahead. But we're not going to be able to change these frameworks. They are there as they are. We won't be able to keep them out of Germany, even if we wanted to. And this technology is really on every end device, and it's going to be on all the wonderful data glasses we see now. So we're going to get all kinds of gadgets and devices that incorporate this technology, and for me there's no alternative. Full speed ahead now and try to make the best of this situation. 

[Philipp]
We have another question a bit in another direction. So to speak, that not only the tool is used by the students, but that the AI is also actively used as a tool in teaching. And we would be particularly interested in how children or students with learning difficulties could be helped. So to speak, whether AI opens up new possibilities that can hopefully also be used there. 

[Weßels]
Yes, and you can already see that today. We're talking about it now and that's always just a snapshot. The discussion is currently focused on ChatGPT in particular. But if you really look at ChatGpt, which is just one small piece of the puzzle in the entire construct, but just this tool, this tool already offers such great opportunities for individualized and self-determined learning as never before. I always like to give an example where I enter, in any language, "ChatGPT You are my vocabulary trainer", "You are my math trainer". And then I say "Binomial formula, Explain me the binomial formulas, please with an example" and the tool rattles off. If you are lucky, the right binomial formula comes out with a meaningful explanation. And then I can, for example, if I have a hard time with mathematics, I can now really go uninhibited into this, so to say in a protected space, although we know that it is now more of a legal problem. What does Microsoft and OpenAI do with the data. But at least my classmates and teachers don't see what I'm doing.

That means I can ask my very specific questions, which I might otherwise be ashamed of, which I wouldn't ask at all, because I would have to admit that I don´t know about it or because I've already asked that three times. I can ask that individually with this tool and I can have it explained to me ten times if I want to. And I can also ask "Why is there an X inside the formula?" There I thought about an example with X + 3. I am a mathematician now, but I can imagine that there are students who ask themselves, "why is there now such an X inside". Before it was 3 + 4 squared and now suddenly X + 4. Why is the X there? Such questions and such a tool is designed to be extremely polite in its wording. It doesn't come back: "You still haven't understood" or "Don't ask the same question again", but it is so polite, so courteous and therefore so motivating. Not like us humans, I think.

After explaining it ten times, we humans would just say "No, please read it again at home". We have already explained it so many times. So this impatience, which we have, or also the lack of time. We can't respond to every single student or every single pupil that individually. Incidentally, we also have a major shortage of skilled workers in this area, and I think this is discussed far too little. This is highly political. Oh God, now the bots here are already replacing the teachers. But here, too, I think we need a healthy amount of pragmatism.

In many places, this is discussed as a problem. We have two problems and maybe one problem solves the other problem to some extent and from my point of view we have to discuss that a little bit more positively, a little bit more openly. Now to the issues with ADHD and such handicaps. Yes, this individualized learning is certainly positive for that. But I see another aspect and that makes us very worried, which is the loneliness, the isolation, so that you do not participate in the group, in the social interaction and also the addiction, so the gambling addiction that we have in many places. I also experience this in my environment, that there are addictions among students who live in their digital world, but no longer in the real world.

And how do we deal with it? So that we don't lose them in the digital world? That really is a great danger and also what the role of us teachers should be. I believe, and so many people say this, so I am not a school teacher or will become a school teacher. We are all in the higher education sector, so we are self-taught. So in the university of applied sciences, we were all once in business and then all of a sudden we became professors.

But we in our role, we also have a role model function, so we, we also have to present our stance on issues, but we also have to take care of personal issues. So when students come to the consultation hours, quite often it is not professional problems that are in the foreground, but quite often it is also the personal life situation, there are crises, there are fears. So this is such a conglomerate of topics that occupy us people, and now we can get much more involved, because we have more time for this care, the individual approach to each student to take in hand. Offering help and advice - I see that as an opportunity, because we will probably be relieved, so to speak, in this operational handling. Uh, yes. And all in all, light and shadow again. 

[Philipp]
To round that off a bit. What do you think? In general more as an opportunity or more as a major threat?

[Weßels]
It will change the world and I am currently lived ambivalence. I've had moments where I thought it should never have been launched in the first place. But Pandora's box has been opened. And the fathers and mothers of this technology were also aware of that. They didn't want to release it at first. They knew that it was high risk, and there were enough people, from Hawking to other big players and experts, who warned. That's an extreme ambivalence that we're seeing there. But I'm also always fascinated by this live experiment that I get to be a part of now and where I think we also have the opportunity to be able to shape it. To a certain extent. To experience that here at republica, that there are so many people who say yes, this also offers as much potential, let's make something out of it. I think that's also great somehow, for my personal life as well. 

I was able to experience how the Internet came over us. I've always said to my students, "Oh, how great that I've experienced this live. New times, new beginnings, that was for us, if you imagine, when my generation grew up there were no search engines. And then came the search engines. And we thought to ourselves, "This is gigantic. All of a sudden, the world and the world's knowledge is available to us. So for us that was really, I still remember, that was so great, but that now something like that is coming again, which is perhaps even greater. A lot of people say yes, this is even more bigger, but we don't know. Probably it will be even bigger. This is another new era that we're heading into and hopefully it won't wipe us out. There are also these wonderful, these terrible dystopias. But I always have to laugh a lot, because my students always immediately come up with science fiction films. They have knowledge, they can tell you exactly what's going to happen, this and this and this, and we've already seen that, and then the films immediately start and science fiction is immediately involved, without you being able to ignore it. And then you have to analyze that again very soberly. What is going on in our minds, only because we have seen it in science fiction films on time? And what is really going on now, when we look at it soberly, and to what extent can we steer and control it?
